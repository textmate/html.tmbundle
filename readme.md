This is a quick fork of the HTML bundle on that comes with Textmate, to allow php array structures to be folded, like other container objects, like javascript objects `{}`, or arrays in other languages `[]`.

These are in the html bundle, because PHP syntax is actually evaluated in this bundle, when dealing with files that use both kinds of markup

### How to install

First of all jump to your Bundles directory:

        cd ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/

Then remove the existing bundle

        rm -rf HTML.tmbundle

Then clone this one in:

        git clone https://chris-d-adams@github.com/chris-d-adams/html.tmbundle.git HTML.tmbundle
